# League signup process s13
For the first time, in season 13 the VESA league will be utilizing a discord bot for signups. No longer will users need to log in to google and submit a form.
This will also help us expedite our sorting process as we won't have to worry about any discord username misspellings or other discrepancies while organizing.
It should also reduce the amount of time we spend assigning roles during placements.

We understand this is a new process for our users and are here to help you complete your signup correctly.
Please provide accurate information on your skill level, comp experience and vesa experience so we can sort and prioritize you correctly for placement matches. Not only does it hurt the whole lobby (57 other real human beings!) when inaccurate information is provided, it also hurts your ability to place into an appropriate division 

**Please read the following how to document so you don't spend unneeded time making mistakes during your signup!**

If you're here because you didn't read and you're having issues, please read the steps and then the "something wrong" section to help you get signed up!

## What to do if something went wrong?

Fret not if the bot replies that you did something wrong, you don't have to retype everything, simply click on the little blue league-signup button on the line that reads "TheHeuman used league-signup" yours will say your username obviously
That will open a little popup where you can choose to open the command and then fix any of the things that you entered incorrectly
